### 1. Describe a situation where you had to explain a complex technical idea to a non-technical person (e.g., a client or manager). How did you go about it?
**Answer (My Experience):**  
I once worked at Manual, where we needed to transition from a monolithic system to microservices. Our non-technical manager was concerned about how such a big architectural change could affect stability. To address this, I used a **Jenga tower** analogy: removing too many blocks at once risks collapsing the tower, so it’s far safer to replace them one at a time. This step-by-step process mirrored our planned migration strategy, ensuring that we avoided sudden disruptions. I also created a **simple visual diagram** showing how we would gradually replace individual components. By focusing on how these technical decisions supported **business goals**—namely, reliability and smooth performance—the manager understood the concept’s value. Ultimately, I received full support, which made the migration a success.

### 2. Imagine you are working in a team where someone else proposes a different technical solution to a problem than you. How do you handle it?
**Answer (My Approach):**  
In a project at Snubes GmbH, a teammate suggested using **GraphQL** instead of REST APIs. Initially, I believed **REST with caching (Redis)** was the more optimal choice for our needs. Instead of dismissing their idea, I listened carefully, acknowledging the benefits of GraphQL’s flexible queries. However, I also highlighted how REST, combined with caching, could yield simpler code and faster performance in our specific context. To avoid guesswork, I proposed running an **experiment**: we built small-scale implementations of both solutions and tested them under similar conditions. Our results clearly showed that REST with caching performed better for our particular use case. By adopting a collaborative approach—hearing out my teammate’s idea, providing my perspective, and then backing decisions with data—we reached an outcome that balanced performance, simplicity, and maintainability.

### 3. Give an example of a situation where you identified a potential problem in a project early on and solved it before it became a bigger issue.
**Answer (My Experience):**  
While working on an **e-commerce project** at Manual, I noticed that several **database queries** were running slowly, which would become a major bottleneck during peak traffic. I used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to pinpoint problem queries—some were performing full table scans instead of leveraging indexes. I quickly optimized those **database indexes** and implemented **Redis caching** for the most frequently accessed data. This proactive approach led to a **65% improvement in API response times**, preventing the slow queries from ever spiraling into a critical user-experience issue.

### 4. Tell me about a time when you had to complete a project under tight deadlines. How did you prioritize tasks, and what was the outcome?
**Answer (My Experience):**  
At Manual, we had a **payday campaign** launching soon, which meant a drastic traffic spike was imminent. With a tight deadline, I prioritized finding and resolving performance issues first—analyzing logs and metrics to identify the biggest bottlenecks. I streamlined queries by adding indexes, set up **Redis caching** to reduce repetitive database hits, and worked with DevOps to **scale our infrastructure**. I also ran **stress tests** to simulate the upcoming load, giving us valuable insights into potential failure points. Setting up **failover mechanisms** and ensuring auto-scaling gave us a strong safety net. As a result, the platform handled the surge with **zero downtime** and boosted conversions significantly during the campaign.

### 5. What are the differences between require, include, require_once, and include_once in PHP? When would you use each?
**Answer:**  
- **require**: Loads a file, and if it’s missing, the script stops execution with a fatal error. I use `require` for files absolutely essential to my application.  
- **include**: Also loads a file but only emits a warning if the file is missing and keeps running. I use `include` for optional files.  
- **require_once**: Works like `require`, but prevents loading the same file multiple times, which helps avoid re-declaration errors.  
- **include_once**: Similar to `include`, but ensures a file is only loaded once.

### 6. Explain the difference between a Service and a Controller in Symfony. How would you create a new Service and use it in a Controller?
**Answer (My Explanation):**  
In Symfony, a **Controller** primarily handles HTTP requests and responses, acting as the first point of contact for incoming traffic. On the other hand, a **Service** holds reusable business logic. This separation of concerns keeps the code clean and easier to maintain.

#### Example: Service and Controller

```php
// src/Service/EmailService.php
namespace App\Service;

class EmailService {
    public function sendEmail(string $to, string $subject, string $message): string {
        // Simulate sending an email
        return "Email sent to $to with subject: $subject";
    }
}
```

```php
// src/Controller/EmailController.php
namespace App\Controller;

use App\Service\EmailService;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;

class EmailController extends AbstractController {
    private $emailService;

    public function __construct(EmailService $emailService) {
        $this->emailService = $emailService;
    }

    /**
     * @Route(\"/send-email\", methods={\"GET\"})
     */
    public function sendEmail(): JsonResponse {
        try {
            $message = $this->emailService->sendEmail(\"user@example.com\", \"Welcome\", \"Thank you for signing up!\");
            return $this->json([\"message\" => $message]);
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            return $this->json([\"error\" => \"Failed to send email: \" . $e->getMessage()], 500);
        }
    }
}
```

### 7. Create a simple Symfony project that implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for a Product entity using a MySQL database. Explain the steps and code you used.
**Answer (Step-by-Step):**
1. **Set up a New Project**: I would use the Symfony CLI to generate a fresh project, then require the ORM and MakerBundle:
   ```bash
   symfony new ProductCRUD --version=\"6.0\"
   cd ProductCRUD
   composer require orm symfony/maker-bundle
   ```

2. **Configure the Database**: In `.env`, update the `DATABASE_URL` to point to my MySQL instance:
   ```dotenv
   DATABASE_URL=\"mysql://db_user:db_password@127.0.0.1:3306/my_database?serverVersion=8&charset=utf8mb4\"
   ```

3. **Create the Product Entity**:
   ```bash
   php bin/console make:entity Product
   ```
   I’d add fields like `name`, `description`, and `price` in `Product.php`. Then run the migrations:
   ```bash
   php bin/console make:migration
   php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
   ```

4. **Generate CRUD**:
   ```bash
   php bin/console make:crud Product
   ```
   This scaffolds a `ProductController` and templates for listing, creating, editing, and deleting products.

5. **Review the Code**: I’d check `ProductController` for the `index()`, `new()`, `edit()`, and `delete()` methods. The corresponding Twig templates (in `templates/product`) handle the front-end forms.

6. **Test It**: By navigating to `/product`, I can create new products, view all products, edit an existing product, and delete as needed.

### 8. Describe how you would handle an unexpected error message in a Symfony project that occurs when processing an HTTP request.
**Answer (My Process):**
- **Check the Logs**: Symfony logs stored in `var/log/dev.log` or `var/log/prod.log` usually reveal stack traces that indicate the root cause.
- **Use the Profiler**: In dev mode, I’d open the Symfony profiler to see detailed error reports.
- **Reproduce the Error**: I attempt to isolate the cause by replicating the environment or configuration.
- **Add Exception Handling**: If necessary, I’d wrap the problematic code in `try-catch` blocks or create a custom exception listener.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Tools like **Sentry** or **New Relic** help track production errors in real time.

Through systematic logging, debugging, and error handling, I can resolve the unexpected error quickly and maintain the application’s stability.

### 9. Strategic API Integration and Data Management
**Answer (My Strategy):**  
When integrating APIs from Sprengnetter, GeoMap, and Europace, I start by defining a **unified data model** for property valuations. I’d build an **API gateway** or facade layer to manage authentication, standardize requests, and handle rate-limiting. I’d use **asynchronous processing**—for instance, with RabbitMQ—to avoid blocking calls when an external service is slow or unreachable. **Caching** frequently requested data in Redis ensures high performance and resilience against external API downtime. Finally, I’d incorporate **feature flags** for smooth deployment of updates if an API changes.

**Potential Challenges**:
- **Data Consistency**: Different APIs may conflict, so I’d implement timestamps or checksums to ensure we’re always using the latest data.
- **API Downtime**: Falling back to cached data or displaying partial info gracefully is essential.
- **Security**: I’d employ HTTPS/TLS and store credentials in secure vaults.

This strategy ensures the system has fresh, reliable data without overloading external APIs or risking downtime.

### 10. Scalable and Secure Database Architecture
**Answer (My Design):**  
For a large-scale real estate platform, I’d typically use **PostgreSQL** or MySQL for core structured data. **Table partitioning** can help handle large volumes of property info, while **sharding** can distribute data across multiple nodes. I’d enable **RBAC** (role-based access control) at the database level to protect sensitive data. **Encryption at rest** and in transit (SSL/TLS) adds another layer of security.

**Scalability** can be achieved via **read replicas** and load-balancing. To future-proof, I’d set up automated backups, test restore procedures, and monitor performance with **Prometheus** + **Grafana** to detect anomalies early.

---

### 11. Complex System Integration and Optimization
**Answer (My Approach):**  
I’d adopt an **event-driven architecture**—using Kafka or RabbitMQ—to keep external integrations loosely coupled. Each subsystem subscribes to relevant events and updates in near real-time. If external APIs have strict rate limits or experience downtime, I’d set up **circuit breakers** and retry logic. For data conflicts, I’d implement a **priority weighting** system or allow manual override where necessary. **Caching** with Redis or Elasticsearch ensures quick lookups, while **distributed tracing** (e.g., Jaeger) makes it easier to pinpoint bottlenecks in a multi-service environment.

This way, users would consistently see current data, and the system gracefully degrades if an external dependency fails, maintaining overall reliability.
